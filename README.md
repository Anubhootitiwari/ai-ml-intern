Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Objective
This project demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing techniques on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning models.

 Steps Performed
Imported Dataset & Explored Data

Checked data types, shape, null values.

Generated descriptive statistics.

Handled Missing Values

Age â†’ Filled with median.

Embarked â†’ Filled with mode.

Dropped Cabin column (too many missing values).

Encoded Categorical Variables

Converted Sex using Label Encoding.

Applied One-Hot Encoding for Embarked.

Feature Scaling

Standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) using StandardScaler.

Outlier Detection & Removal

Used IQR method for Age and Fare.

Visualized with Boxplots.

Visualizations

Boxplots for outlier detection.

Correlation heatmap using Seaborn.

Saved Cleaned Dataset

Final cleaned data exported to titanic_cleaned.csv.
